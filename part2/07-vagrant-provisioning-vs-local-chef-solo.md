Running Vagrant provisioning vs a local chef-solo run
-----------------------------------------------------

With a working `chef-solo` converge, this is a good time to talk about using local chef-solo and running Chef via Vagrant. As I am developing/testing a cookbook I personally prefer the local chef-solo method. It allows for faster iterations. But when you get your cookbook where you want it to be, `vagrant provision` is the way to go. For fun let's convert the `base` cookbook we wrote to the `Vagrant` file method.

Luckily Vagrant has mounted the `/vagrant` directory where you did the `vagrant up` from. Go ahead and do something like the following:
```bash
root@chef-book:~/solo# cp -r cookbooks/ /vagrant/
root@chef-book:~/solo#
```
This will copy the cookbooks directory from your `~/solo` working directory into the host file system. Go ahead and drop out of the vm now.
```bash
root@chef-book:~/solo# exit
logout
vagrant@chef-book:~$ exit
logout
Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.
[~/vagrant/chef-book] % ls
Vagrantfile cookbooks
```
As you can see your `cookbooks` directory is there. Next you'll need to open up the `vagrantfile` and add the run_list to it so chef-solo can do its magic.

Vagrant::Config.run do |config|
  config.vm.box = "chef-book"
  config.vm.box_url = "http://files.vagrantup.com/precise64.box"
  config.vm.host_name = 'chef-book'

  #config.vm.provision :shell, :inline => $script
  config.vm.provision "chef_solo" do |chef|
    chef.add_recipe "base"
  end
end
```
Notice I commented out the `:shell` provisioning and added the `chef_solo` provisioner. Save this, exit the editor, and run `vagrant halt` then `vagrant up` and if needed `vagrant provision` and you should see something like this:

Hopefully you get the beauty of the built in provisioner. You can select the cookbooks that you'd like to test out, edit the run_list and run the provisioning to get the box how you want. Don't get me wrong there's much more to it, the [docs](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/provisioning/chef_solo.html) have a ton more, but this is just a basic example.

Now let's move on to your most important tool as a chef; [knife](../part3/08-knife.md).
